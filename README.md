# QMetric Java Exercise

Our Java coding exercise is inspired by 
[PragDave Supermaket Kata](http://codekata.com/kata/kata01-supermarket-pricing/). 
 
> [...] to experiment with various models for representing money and prices that are flexible enough to deal with 
>[a variety of] pricing schemes, and at the same time are generally usable (at the checkout, for stock management, 
>order entry, and so on). 

## The task

This project provides the code for an initial model of a supermarket. 
The supermarket's inventory consists of _products_ that can be sold _by unit_ (e.g. a can of baked beans) or _by weight_
(e.g. loose carrots).
The total price of a shopping basket has currently been calculated as a simple sum of its items. 
  
The supermarket would like to offer _pricing discount_ schemes, for example:
- Buy one, get one free
- Buy two items for Â£1
- Buy three items for the price of two
- Buy one kilo of vegetables for half price

Some discounts would be applicable for single products (e.g. a can of baked beans), while others could apply across a 
group of products (e.g. vegetables).

Your task is to extend the functionality of Basket to implement _a component_ that can calculate the __total amount__ 
to pay for the items in a basket, __including any discounts that would be applicable__ for the current state of the 
basket.

* You should think about how the relationships between Basket, Item, and Product will need to be refactored to achieve 
this
* You should consider how your solution could be extended to provide more complicated discount schemes

First and foremost this is an opportunity for you to demonstrate your _software design_ skills within a small problem 
space. 

Please read through the description carefully and implement a solution that includes __at least one__ of the pricing 
discount schemes described.

We would like you spend __no more than one hour__ on this task. 
 
### We are looking for...

- Clean, tidy, tested, and __working__ code (with accurate pricing calculations) 
- Use of appropriate design patterns and [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles
- Small incremental changes with good comments, as demonstrated in your commit history

**Above all, we would rather see a small codebase with fewer features than failure to observe the points above.**

You may add any libraries you feel are appropriate.
But we don't expect to see databases or other persistence layers, dependency injection frameworks, web servers, REST 
APIs, or web frameworks;
we are **not** looking for a fully functioning supermarket system!

### Tips

- Plan your time before you start coding. Start small and add features incrementally
- Focus on the pricing model and the behaviour of your components -- you only need to demonstrate that your design 
works, rather than an exhaustive model of numerous supermarket items 
- If you run out of time, describe your intentions in the [NOTES.md](NOTES.md) file

We really don't want you to over-engineer the solution -- and you really don't have time for that! -- but be prepared 
to extend the functionality in the next step of the interview process. 

## Submission

Clone or fork this project into a _publicly accessible_ git repository of your own, and email the URL to to

Good Luck!

## Approach
I've added a Discount interface that can be implemented for all the discounts. All the discounts should implement
this interface and define the method calculateDiscount for the item received.

For doing it, any item should be provided with the kind of discount that we want to apply. So there is a discount
strategy defined in each one.

Item interface has now 3 extra methods to be implemented in the specific item classes
- BigDecimal discount();
This method should be implemented in any item implementation. It calls the discount implementation to calculate
the discount to each item. At the moment I think there is not any difference between the implementation in ItemByUnit
and the one in ItemByWeight. I create one in each item but we can avoid duplication of code defining it maybe in the 
interface as a default method or in an abstract class. I didn't think specifically on it yet.    

- BigDecimal amount();
This method is used to know the number of elements of each item bought. We need it to pass to the specific discount 
strategy and calculate it. 

- BigDecimal priceByUnit();
We could have a problem with the ItemByWeight if we want to apply the specific discount. For example let's say that we
 want a discount of One kilo at half price. We can't calculate it as price is already defined as
 ```product.pricePerKilo().multiply(weightInKilos).setScale(2, BigDecimal.ROUND_HALF_UP);```. As this discount needs
 the pricePerKilo I have added this extra pricePerUnit method that contains the price per kilo in Weighted items
 and just call the ```price()``` method in ItemByUnit.

## Testing
I added 2 tests classes to check the Discounts already defined. I didn't add any test on BasketTest as I covered
 the discounts on the unit test classes. I think it could be enough, but we could add an extra test in BasketTest class 
also with a real list of elements.

## Possible Improvements
- At the moment all the discounts can be applied to all kind of items (itemByUnit and ItemByWeight). That's not ideal 
because some offers can only be defined for some kind of items. To prevent this I've added a basic check in some discount
in order to throw an exception (not caught at the moment) to avoid this situation.
